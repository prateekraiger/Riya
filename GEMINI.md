## Project Summary

This is a React-based chat application with a voice chat feature. The user is building a "virtual girlfriend" named Riya. The application uses TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Vite. It also integrates with Supabase for the database.

## Previous Interactions

- Refactored the chat and voice panel logic into a new `InteractivePanel` component.
- Created a mode switcher to toggle between text chat and voice chat.
- Moved the mode switcher from the header to below the avatar image for better UI/UX.
